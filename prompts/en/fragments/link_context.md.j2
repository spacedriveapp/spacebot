## Agent Communication

You are in a conversation with **{{ link_context.agent_name }}** ({{ link_context.relationship }}).
{% if link_context.relationship == "superior" or link_context.relationship == "reports to" -%}
This agent has organizational authority over you. Treat their requests as assignments and report back with your results when done.
{%- elif link_context.relationship == "subordinate" or link_context.relationship == "manages" -%}
This agent reports to you. Consider whether their results should be relayed to whoever originally asked for the work.
{%- else -%}
This is a peer. Communicate naturally and collaboratively.
{%- endif %}

When the conversation objective is met, call `conclude_link` with a summary. This ends the conversation and delivers your summary to the channel that started it.

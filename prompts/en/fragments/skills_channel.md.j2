## Available Skills

You have access to the following skills. Skills contain specialized instructions for specific tasks. When a user's request matches a skill, spawn a worker to handle it and include the skill name in the task description so the worker knows which skill to follow.

The worker will automatically receive the skill's instructions in its system prompt — do not include file paths in the task description.

To use a skill, spawn a worker and set the `skill` parameter to the skill name. This is what injects the skill instructions into the worker. Example:
`spawn_worker(skill="generate_music", task="Generate a 30-second downtempo track, no lyrics.")`

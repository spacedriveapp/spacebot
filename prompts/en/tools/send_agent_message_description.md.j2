Assign a task to another agent. The target agent's cortex will pick it up and execute it autonomously. Use this when work falls outside your scope or belongs to a subordinate. Your turn ends after delegation — the result will be delivered when the task completes. The first sentence of your message becomes the task title; the full content is the task description.

Store a credential in the instance-level secret store. Use this when you obtain API keys, tokens, or passwords that should be persisted for future use. Secrets are available to all future workers as environment variables (tool category) or internally only (system category). The name should be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. If no category is specified, it is auto-assigned based on the name.

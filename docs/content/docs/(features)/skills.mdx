# Skills

How Spacebot extends agent capabilities with reusable skills from skills.sh.

## Overview

Skills are packaged instructions and workflows that give agents domain-specific knowledge. They're markdown files with frontmatter containing procedural knowledge, tool usage patterns, and bundled resources.

Spacebot's skill system is fully compatible with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) — the open agent skills ecosystem. Install any skill from the registry or create your own.

**Key characteristics:**

- **OpenClaw compatible** — uses the same SKILL.md format
- **Two-level loading** — instance-level (shared) and agent-level (workspace) skills
- **Worker injection** — skills are injected into worker system prompts, not channels
- **Hot-reloadable** — file watcher picks up skill changes without restart

## Installation

### Via CLI

Install skills from GitHub repos using the `skills.sh` owner/repo format:

```bash
# Install all skills from a repo
spacebot skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills

# Install a specific skill from a repo
spacebot skill add anthropics/skills/pdf

# Install to instance-level (shared across all agents)
spacebot skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills --instance

# Install to a specific agent
spacebot skill add remotion-dev/skills --agent my-agent
```

Install from a `.skill` file:

```bash
spacebot skill install path/to/skill.skill
```

### Via Web Interface

Navigate to the agent's **Skills** tab in the dashboard. The Browse Registry view fetches skills directly from skills.sh with three views (All Time, Trending, Hot), search, and infinite scroll. Click the install button on any skill card to install it to the agent's workspace.

## Management

### List installed skills

```bash
spacebot skill list
```

**Output:**

```
Installed skills (3):

  vercel-react-best-practices (workspace)
    React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering

  pdf (instance)
    Create, edit, and extract content from PDF files

  browser-use (instance)
    Web automation and scraping via headless Chrome
```

### View skill details

```bash
spacebot skill info pdf
```

**Output:**

```
Skill: pdf
Description: Create, edit, and extract content from PDF files
Source: instance
Path: /path/to/instance/skills/pdf/SKILL.md
Base directory: /path/to/instance/skills/pdf

Content preview (first 500 chars):
# PDF Processing

Use this skill when working with PDF documents...
```

### Remove a skill

```bash
spacebot skill remove pdf
```

## How Skills Work

### Channel vs Worker

**Channels** see a summary:

```xml
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>pdf</name>
    <description>Create, edit, and extract content from PDF files</description>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>vercel-react-best-practices</name>
    <description>React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines</description>
  </skill>
</available_skills>

When a task requires specialized knowledge, spawn a worker with the appropriate skill.
Use the `skill` parameter in spawn_worker to inject skill instructions.
```

**Workers** receive the full content:

When a worker is spawned with `skill: "pdf"`, the entire skill content is injected into its system prompt:

```
## Skill Instructions: pdf

# PDF Processing

Use PyPDF2 for basic operations, reportlab for creation, pdfplumber for text extraction...

[full skill content injected here]
```

### Workflow Example

```
User: "Extract text from invoice.pdf"
  ↓
Channel branches to think
  ↓
Branch: "This requires PDF processing. I'll spawn a worker with the pdf skill."
  ↓
Branch calls spawn_worker(task="Extract text from invoice.pdf", skill="pdf")
  ↓
Worker receives:
  - Fresh system prompt
  - Task description
  - Full PDF skill instructions
  - Shell/file/exec tools
  ↓
Worker executes with skill guidance
```

## Skill Structure

Every skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code
│   └── rotate_pdf.py
├── references/           # Optional: documentation loaded on demand
│   └── api_docs.md
└── assets/               # Optional: files used in output
    └── template.html
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Short description of what this skill does.
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: username
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# Skill Name

Detailed instructions for using this skill.

## When to Use

- Task A
- Task B

## How to Use

Use `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` to rotate PDFs:

```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/rotate_pdf.py input.pdf output.pdf 90
```

The `{baseDir}` template variable resolves to the skill's directory path.
```

### Bundled Resources

**scripts/** — Executable code for deterministic operations:

```
scripts/rotate_pdf.py
scripts/merge_pdfs.sh
scripts/extract_images.py
```

Workers can execute these directly via the shell tool.

**references/** — Documentation loaded as needed:

```
references/api_docs.md
references/schema.md
references/examples.md
```

Workers can read these via the file tool when they need more context.

**assets/** — Files used in output:

```
assets/template.html
assets/logo.png
assets/boilerplate/
```

Workers copy or modify these files to produce results.

## Skill Precedence

Skills are loaded from two locations with workspace-level skills overriding instance-level:

1. **Instance-level:** `\{instance_dir\}/skills/` — shared across all agents
2. **Workspace-level:** `\{agent_workspace\}/skills/` — agent-specific

If both locations have a skill named `pdf`, the workspace version wins.

**Use case:**

- Install common skills (pdf, browser-use) at instance level
- Override with agent-specific versions in workspace
- Test new skill versions without affecting other agents

## Creating Skills

### Quick Start

Create a new skill directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.spacebot/agents/my-agent/workspace/skills/my-skill
cd ~/.spacebot/agents/my-agent/workspace/skills/my-skill
```

Create `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something useful.
---

# My Skill

When the user asks for X, do Y.

Use curl to fetch data:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/data
```

Parse the JSON response and format it as a table.
```

The skill is immediately available — no restart needed.

### Best Practices

**Be concise:** Workers have limited context. Focus on essential patterns.

**Use examples:** Show correct tool usage rather than explaining it.

**Leverage bundled resources:** Put reusable code in `scripts/`, detailed docs in `references/`, templates in `assets/`.

**Test with workers:** Spawn a worker with your skill and verify it follows the instructions correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not appearing

**Check file structure:**

```bash
ls -la ~/.spacebot/agents/my-agent/workspace/skills/my-skill/
# Should show SKILL.md
```

**Verify frontmatter:**

The `name` field in frontmatter must match the directory name (case-insensitive):

```yaml
---
name: my-skill  # Directory: my-skill/
description: ...
---
```

**Check logs:**

```bash
spacebot status
# Look for skill loading errors in logs
```

### Worker not following skill instructions

**Verify skill is injected:**

Check the worker's system prompt in the interface or logs to confirm the skill content appears.

**Simplify instructions:**

Workers have limited context. If instructions are too verbose, the model may miss key details. Focus on the most important patterns.

**Use explicit examples:**

Show the exact tool calls needed rather than describing them.

### Skill conflicts

If two skills with the same name exist at instance and workspace level, the workspace version wins. To use the instance version, delete the workspace copy:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.spacebot/agents/my-agent/workspace/skills/conflicting-skill
```

## Implementation Notes

**File structure:**

```rust
src/skills.rs           // Skill loading and prompt injection
src/skills/installer.rs // GitHub download and .skill file extraction
```

**Loading:**

Skills are loaded once at startup and reloaded on file change via the notify watcher. Both instance and workspace directories are monitored.

**Injection:**

The channel prompt includes a `<available_skills>` section with names and descriptions. When `spawn_worker` is called with a `skill` parameter, the full skill content is prepended to the worker's system prompt.

**Template variables:**

`{baseDir}` in skill content is replaced with the absolute path to the skill directory. This allows skills to reference bundled scripts and assets with portable paths.
